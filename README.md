DEV281x-Labs

Lab materials that deal with the practice and implementation of various ReactJS features by means of mini projects
-------------------------------------------------------------
Lab 1 - A vehicle sale listing page where the HTML elements are generated using functional React Components

Lab 2 - An arithmetic trivia game application generated using functional and class React Components. The game runs in an inifinite loop allowing the player to answer arithmetic quiz questions by selecting one out of four choices. Correct and incorrect answers are tallied up and displayed to the player. A "Restart" button is present giving the player the option of restarting a new game at any point

Lab 3 - A course registration page implemented using functional, class and controlled React components. The user specifies their first and last name, the activity (science lab, swimming, cooking or painting) they choose and checks off any special attention (dietary restrictions, physical disabilities and/or medical needs) they may require. Once all the information are inputted, clicking on the submit button will dynamically generate a new record in a table. A "X" button is also generated in the registration listing allowing the user to delete any record they choose
